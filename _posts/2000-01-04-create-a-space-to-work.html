	A DIY education is no small undertaking. Your plan deserves a space to be mapped out and shared with others.</p>
<p>
	Here are examples of people who have created a space the web to track their plan:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Pippa Buchanan: <a href="http://pippabuchanan.com/about/">http://pippabuchanan.com/about/</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Weezie Yancel-Siegel: <a href="http://eduventurist.org/about/">http://eduventurist.org/about/</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Wendy Dunst: <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/learning-path-working-class-activism/">http://p2pu.org/en/groups/learning-path-working-class-activism/</a></p>

<p>
	<strong>Create a space on the web to work in and share it. </strong>Start a blog like Pippa or add a page to your website like Devin. You can Hack P2PU like Wendy to map a plan others can copy and and customize. Or you can build a whole site around your plan like Weezie.</p>
