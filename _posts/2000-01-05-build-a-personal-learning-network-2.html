<div class="richtext_section"><p>
	<span>Your Personal Learning Network (PLN) is the group of people who feed your learning head. In a true network, you’re a contributor, not just a consumer. Meaningful participation in this network is an integral part of your personal learning plan.</span></p>
<p>
	<span>Where can you find people on the web?</span></p>
